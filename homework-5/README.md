# A little bit of information about the day
## Lectures
### 1. OS:
Was **almost** asleep and dedicated this time for the breakfast
### 2. BP:
Managed to figure out some principles for solving higher math problems, generally I am very satisfied :)
### 3. DM:
I like the *lecturer* so can't complain

Somehow have finished [hw](https://github.com/sxzhine/homework) finally!

A random piece of code: \``` training(event) {
this.level()
if(this.lev >= event[2]) { this.exp += (event[1])
this.achievements(event[0])
return event[0]
}
else {
return "Not strong enough"
}
}`\`` - the task was fun but should've spent more time on stylistics
